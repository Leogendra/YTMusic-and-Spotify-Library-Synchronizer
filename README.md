## **Installation** (Read it carefully!)

1. Clone this repository

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Obtain your Spotify API credentials by creating an application on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

1. In your application settings, add `http://localhost:5500/callback` to your Redirect URIs (Settings > Edit > Redirect URIs).

1. Set up the environment variables for Spotify by creating `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=Your_Client_ID
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=Your_Client_Secret
   ```
   
1. To setup the connection to your YTMusic account, first run the script `python main.py`, it will generate a `browser.json` file in the `tokens/` directory.

1. To obtain your Cookie and Authorization, go to `https://music.youtube.com/` and log in with your account. Then press `F12` to open the Developer Tools, go to the `Network` tab, and filter (at the top) with `/browse`. Refresh the page and look for the `browse?ctoken=` request, click on it, and go to the `Request headers` section, and copy your `Cookie` and `Authorization` values into the `browser.json` file.

1. Run the script `python main.py` again to connetc to your Spotify account.

1. An URL is generated. Open the URL in your browser, copy the code after `?code=`, and paste it into the terminal.

1. You are now ready to (finally) use the synchronizer!
